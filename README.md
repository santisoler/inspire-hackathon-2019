# Forecast Enhancer

Cammalot Team

Here you will find the Jupyter Notebooks written for the San Juan INSPIRE Hackathon
2019.
They implement a method to automatically fetch weather station data from the Servicio
Meteorol√≥gico Nacional and ERA-5 climate data from Copernicus, in order to produce an
improved forecast based on the data collected by the weather station.
It solves the issues regarding the low resolution of the forecast models and the
incorporation of local effects that may not be taken into account by it.
